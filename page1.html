<h1>About the Dataset</h1>

<p style="text-align:left;font-family: Freestyle Script;font-size:125%;">Questions about Dataset<br><br>
What is the dataset?
The dataset I have chosen is about the Monthly Mortgage Repayments (by Dwelling Structure) from 2011-2016.<br><br>

Why is the dataset collected?
This dataset was collected to monitor the trends that occur during 2011 and 2016 separately and/or the growth and declining trends from 2011 to 2016<br><br>

Which government department do you think will use this?                                   Department of Social Services, Department of Environment and Energy and the Department of Finance<br><br>

Which private sector will use this?
Private sectors in Housing Finance<br><br>

How would this dataset change the way you think about space?
This dataset would challenge the way people think about buying new land properties, the increase of mortgage is seen to those outside the city <br><br>

How does this dataset change across sydney?
In the Campbelltown area and the Western Suburbs, particularly Penrith, Blacktown and Parramatta, there is a higher mortgage rate than other cities. There is a pattern occuring in the 2016 data, it seems that the further you travel away from the city, the higher mortgage rates are. This is visually seen through the light blue circle surrounding Sydney. <br><br>

How does it relate to the latte line?
This dataset refers to the latte line by showing the increase of mortgage rates in business heavy areas with the inclusion that they are near train lines to get to and from the city. <br><br>

How has the dataset changed between 2011 and 2016? The dataset has changed as there has been a shift to the "more expensive side" from the Greater Western Suburbs up to Liverpool and Hornsby, shown through the diagonal line in the picture below<br><br>

Lightest Blue = no change,
Darker Blue = 43%-140% increase,
Darkest Blue = 140%-333% increase<br></br>

How is this dataset significate to peoples lives? 
This dataset is significant to various people interesting in purchasing a home property. As it shows which areas are cheaper but further from CBDs or areas of higher mortgage rates which are more closer to CBDs and train lines etc...<br><br>

Would it be good for this data to change? 
It depends how the data is chaning, the main advantage of a change would be if the mortgage rates are decreasing making housing availible and affordable for more individuals. However at this rate, mortgage rates are increasing thus purcahsing property very costly.<br><br>

If you wanted to change it, how would you change it?
If I were to change the data, I would try and make everything more affordable but since that is nearly impossible, I would try and evenly spread and mix the decrease in mortgage with the increase in mortgages. Hence, making most people to live near trainlines or public services with low costs.<br><br>
